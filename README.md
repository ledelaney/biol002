# Biol 002: Cellular Basis of Life :alien:

This is a course about two things:

1. understanding what it means for something to be alive, and
2. investigating the emergence of life

This repo contains the source for the Spring 2022 [Cellular Basis of Life course website](https://ledelaney.org/teaching/2022/spring/biol002). This digital course "textbook" was built using the R package `bookdown` with the `bs4` theme. The book borrows its bones from Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds).
