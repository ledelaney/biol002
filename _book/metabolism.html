<h2>12: The Catabolic World and Metabolism</h2>
<p>We’ve been getting at this for a long time throughout the course: living ain’t free. We know about how atoms are constructed, and how their construction gives rise to properties that influence the way they interact and form molecules. We know that from this arises special molecules—biological molecules—that build the substances that make life possible. We have toured the two types of cells and discussed some of the jobs those cells carry out, the jobs of life. Where do we get the energy from life? We get it from the sun. Seriously. The sun powers all life on Earth. But we are not solar panels. So how do we actually harness that energy from the sun so we can use it? That’s a big part of being alive: taking the energy from this thing, and using it for that thing.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/sunenergy.jpeg" style="width:40.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The energy for all life comes first from the sun. Living organisms harness that energy through photosynthesis and cellular respiration, the main processes of metabolism.</p>
</div>
<p>We also know how much living organisms have in common. And all living organisms need energy to live. We know this intuitively, because if we don’t eat food, we die. What are we getting from food? We are getting energy and supplies to perform the work necessary for us to continue surviving. This was a major component missing in our exploration of the lipid world: it’s great that lipids spontaneously form boundaries, and boundaries are definitely necessary for most of life’s processes. But where do we get the <em>energy</em>? To look at a cell today, it’s hard to imagine how such a complex ballet of chemical reactions originated. And I’m not even talking about multicellular organisms, that have billions of cells, all performing their own complicated dances. The fact is that we don’t know a lot about the origin of cellular metabolism.</p>
<p>While we know how essential boundaries are to life, some scientists argue that perhaps it was metabolism that originated before true living organisms. Metabolism is essential for the maintenance of life—in particular, the ability to generate the building blocks necessary for growth and reproduction—because this allows the organism to exist somewhat independently from a changing environment. If you rely solely on the immediate surroundings for all the pieces necessary to grow and reproduce you’ll eventually run into problems. First, you’ll burn through whatever is in the immediate surroundings at some point. (It’s not like there are an infinite amount of amphiphiles in prebiotic soup.) Second, you can never colonize a new area. So for life to transcend the realm of random chemical reactions constrained to a specific area, we need metabolism.</p>
<p>In every organism we know of, the core structure of the metabolic network is extremely similar. You will even notice some similarities between cellular respiration and photosynthesis later in this unit. Because the metabolic network thus appears highly conserved, its suggested that it arose very early in the origin of life. But, remember that this can be misleading: there is a difference between the first living organism, and the organism that gave rise to every extant organism (our common ancestor)—these need not be the same! Perhaps the first living organisms are long extinct, and we are remnants of a derived population. But anyway, let’s consider these two hypotheses<a href="metabolism.html#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>modern biochemical reaction sequences are the result of evolutionary selection, and thus are likely very different than the first metabolic systems, or</li>
<li>the initial metabolic reaction network was pre-established on the prebiotic earth and was consequence of the chemical and physical environment when life first emerged</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence in favor of the second hypothesis would then suggest that the basic reaction sequences present in modern metabolism may still be similar to those of the first living organism. So now let’s take a look at metabolism and learn about some of the important kinds of chemical reactions that power all life.</p>
<div id="what-is-metabolism" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>What is metabolism?</h3>
<p><strong>Metabolism</strong> is the sum total of all chemical reactions carried out by living organisms. There are three main jobs carried out by various metabolic pathways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>converting energy from food into energy that can power cellular processes,</li>
<li>converting food into biological molecules that can be used as building blocks for the cell, and</li>
<li>eliminating waste from metabolic processes.</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/metabolism.jpeg" style="width:60.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Metabolism is essentially just breaking stuff down and building stuff up.</p>
</div>
<p>So then, how does metabolism actually function? Enzymes, which are special proteins, catalyze reactions in intersecting <strong>metabolic pathways</strong>, where a molecule is altered in a series of defined steps, resulting in a product. These can be <strong>catabolic</strong> (breaking down molecules, releasing energy) or <strong>anabolic</strong> (building molecules, consuming energy). Entropy is constantly increasing in the universe. But living systems are composed of highly ordered structures. This increase in order is ultimately balanced by living creatures taking in organized forms of matter from their surroundings and replacing them with less ordered forms. We eat proteins, and produce waste like feces, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. During metabolism, the depletion of chemical energy is accounted for by the generation of heat. If you’ve ever been in a packed room with lots of humans, you’ll know how much heat we can generate just by standing there.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/02-thermo.jpg" style="width:70.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Metabolism allows organisms to capture energy and use that energy to perform work. We eat food, break down that food into the pieces we need, and then let off heat and carbon dioxide as waste.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="special-kinds-of-reactions" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Special kinds of reactions</h3>
<p>There are a lot of different kinds of chemical reactions. But for now, we’re going to focus on one kind, called a redox reaction. In a <strong>redox reaction</strong>, electrons are transferred from one reactant to another reactant. Basically, you can think of these reactions as the transfer of electrons. Rememeber that electrons have a negative charge, so when something gains an electron, its charge is <em>reduced</em>. So we say that the addition of electrons is called <strong>reduction</strong>. When something loses electrons, it becomes more positively charged. I wish I could say that we call this something intuitive or smart, but we call it <strong>oxidation</strong>. The reactant that donates the electron is called the <strong>reducing agent</strong> and the substance that accepts the electron is called the <strong>oxidixing agent</strong>. Redox reactions must always occur together, because one substance must transfer the electron and one substance must accept it.</p>
<p>Okay, who cares? Well, these reactions are important because they are the main source of energy for biological organisms on the planet. Also, they are the main source of energy for a bunch of other stuff too, like fire, and also how your car runs on gasoline. Photosynthesis, cellular respiration, combustion, corrosion… all of these processes are actually redox reactions. Rust is basically just the oxidation of metal—we call this oxidation, iron gives its electrons to oxygen, which is a very powerful oxidizer (ha ha). So ultimately we care about these kinds of reactions because they essentially power everything. There is a lot of energy to be made in transferring electrons around.</p>
<p>Now, in an isolated system, all reactions will eventually reach an equilibrium. Once an equilibrium is met there is no more energy left to perform work. Chemical reactions that occur in a test tube will eventually stop as they reach this equilibrium. But if you were to reach equilibrium with your surroundings you would be dead. As I’ve said, in metabolic terms, equilibrium is the same as death. But of course, we are not dead, so how does that work? All living organisms require a continual input of energy to maintain the multitude of metabolic reactions in a state far from equilibrium. The key to maintaining this lack of equilibrium is that the product of a reaction does not accumulate but instead becomes a reactant in the next step until waste products are expelled from the cell.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/04_g.png" style="width:80.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Let’s say that a system has more free energy, it’s less stable, and it has a greater work capacity. When a reaction like this occurs spontaneously, G is reduced (the change in G is negative) and the system releases energy, becoming more stable.</p>
</div>
<p>We know that some reactions build things up, and some reactions break things down. We use a mathematical equation to describe <span class="math inline">\(\Delta G\)</span>, which is called the change in <strong>free energy</strong>. <span class="math inline">\(\Delta G\)</span> can be measured for a reaction, and once we know its value for a particular chemical process, we can use it to predict if the reaction will be spontaneous—occur on its own—or not. A <strong>spontaneous reaction</strong> is energetically favorable and will occur without any input of energy. Essentially, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>G must be negative, meaning energy is released from the reaction. All spontaneous processes decrease the system’s free energy. Processes that have a positive or zero <span class="math inline">\(\Delta G\)</span> are never spontaneous because they require a positive input of energy.</p>
<p>Now that we understand <span class="math inline">\(\Delta G\)</span>, we can understand more about the kinds of metabolic reactions that can occur. Either they require energy, meaning energy must be added, or they release energy. An <strong>exergonic</strong> (prefix <em>ex</em> means “out”) reaction occurs spontaneously and releases energy, meaning <span class="math inline">\(\Delta G\)</span> is negative and the chemical mixture loses free energy. An <strong>endergonic</strong> (prefix <em>en</em> meaning “in”) reaction requires energy, does not occur spontaneously, and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta G\)</span> is positive. This kind of reaction will absorb free energy from the surroundings. The size of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta G\)</span> represents the amount of energy that would be required for the reaction to occur.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/05_exend.jpg" style="width:35.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Exergonic reactions start with more free energy and proceed spontaneously, releasing energy. Endergonic reactions require energy and never occur spontaneously.</p>
</div>
<p>So let’s quick put a few concepts together. Catabolism, the breaking down of molecules, usually releases energy and is thus exergonic. Anabolism, the building of molecules, usually requires energy and is endergonic. Metabolism is just a series of catabolic and anabolic reactions, producing energy, consuming energy.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-currency-of-metabolism" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The currency of metabolism</h3>
<p>We will talk a lot more about ATP when we discuss cellular respiration. For now, we will simply introduce the structure of ATP and explain in broad terms how ATP is <strong>hydrolyzed</strong> (broken down) to release energy. <strong>ATP</strong>, otherwise known as adenosine triphosphate, contains the sugar ribose, with the nitrogenous base adenine, and a chain of three phosphate groups. ATP is built from carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and phosphate groups! Fun fact: organic phosphate can react with water and release energy. What I mean is that bonds between the phosphate groups of ATP can be broken by hydrolysis. When this happens, a molecule of inorganic phosphate (HOPO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, usually abbreviated as P<sub>i</sub>) leaves the ATP, which becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP. The reaction is exergonic and releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed. Why does this reaction release so much energy? It’s not because the phosphate bonds are especially strong. Rather, it’s because the phosphate groups are negatively charged. Because the same charges repel each other, when they are crowded together it causes instability in that region of the molecule. I’ve seen this described as a compressed spring, ready to pop.</p>

<p class="caption">ATP is the currency of energy for all living organisms. When it is hydrolyzed and a phosphate group is released, energy is also released.</p>
</div>
<p>ATP is a renewable resource that can be regenerated by the addition of phosphate to ADP. The free energy required to phosphorylate ADP comes from exergonic breakdown reactions (catabolism) in the cell. This shuttling of inorganic phosphate and energy is called the ATP cycle. It is common in living organisms to couple an energy-yielding (exergonic) process with an energy-consuming (endergonic) process.</p>

<h2>13: Enzymes</h2>
<p>There is a lot of energy in gasoline. We know this, because we pay a lot of money for it so that we can drive our cars around. But we also know that if we just lit gasoline on fire, it would explode and we couldn’t harness the energy inside of it to do anything meaningful. This is the idea behind metabolism—instead of gathering energy explosively, we want to gather it in steps so that we can actually use it to perform work in the cell. The thing is, if we examine life from the perspective of <em>thermodynamics</em> as opposed to simply <em>chemically</em>, we may wish to form a different argument about life’s origins than what we have so far in our prebiotic soup.</p>
<p>The argument goes that there is nothing “life specific” about the building blocks of life, in and of themselves. We have hydrocarbons, along with nucleic acids and amino acids. Maybe the fact that we find hydrocarbons in space, on comets, simply attests to the fact that these molecules are… ordinary. Because it’s not the molecules that make us alive, it’s the fact that we are highly ordered structures existing far from equilibrium with our surrounding environment. Here it is in fancy language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As pointed out by Erwin Schrödinger already in 1944, and even earlier by Ludwig Boltzmann as well as numerous further physicists and physical chemists ever since, all living entities share the same characteristics. They generate order, that is, highly structured and regulated networks of processes, from disorder, i.e., relatively randomly distributed chemical elements. Therefore, they are entropy-decreasing phenomena.<br />
<em>Minerals and the Emergence of Life, Duval et al., 2021</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know that living organisms are able to do this because they are <strong>open systems</strong>, which is to say that they are constantly taking in energy from the surrounding environment and producing waste. The way us life forms get around the second law of thermodynamics is that we maintain our own order by increasing the overall entropy of the universe itself. Our limited <em>decrease</em> of entropy is lower than the <em>increase</em> in entropy of the larger system of which we are a part.</p>
<p>Okay, so all us living organisms need a constant influx of energy, and we use this energy to create order from disorder. As long as we maintain our own order relative to the larger system, we will need this energy, because we ourselves exist far outside equilibrium with our environment. So how do we achieve that? At the core of all living organisms is our cellular metabolism. How nutrients get absorbed and what particular nutrients are consumed depend on the organism, but all cells essentially carry out the same process once we get to the cellular level. It’s called cellular respiration, and we’ll learn all about this week. But we already know the currency of energy—the output of cellular respiration—a molecule called ATP. How organisms make that molecule and how it gives us energy relies heavily on the exploitation of electrochemical gradients, or electrical “tension.” But what makes this possible? How are we powering highly specific reactions, many at the same time, at exactly the right time and place? Enzymes.</p>
<div id="what-enzymes-do" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>What enzymes do</h3>
<p>Put simply, enzymes are proteins. And what do they do? Basically everything. I’m a little bit kidding, but also every single life-sustaining metabolic process requires enzymes, because such processes would not occur at rates fast enough to do the “life-sustaining” part. But anyway, enzymes are <strong>catalysts</strong> that accelerate the rate of chemical reactions. They do this by lowering the <strong>activation energy</strong> required to start the resultant chemical reaction.</p>
<p>Enzymes are also highly specific to the reactions they catalyze. This is important, because many pathways have one particular enzyme that catalyzes one particular step. We need this kind of thing if we are going to actually harness energy to perform meaningful work in the cell.</p>
